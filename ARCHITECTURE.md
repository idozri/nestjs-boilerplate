# Architecture Overview

The NestJS Backend Boilerplate is designed with a modular architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and ease of extension. This document provides an overview of the system architecture, including its layers, dependency injection (DI) usage, folder purposes, and key design decisions.

## System Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture, which includes the following layers:

- **Controller Layer**: Handles incoming requests and returns responses to the client. It delegates business logic to the service layer.
- **Service Layer**: Contains the business logic of the application. Services are responsible for processing data and interacting with repositories.
- **Repository Layer**: Manages data access and persistence. It interacts with the database and provides an abstraction over data operations.

## Dependency Injection (DI)

NestJS uses a powerful DI system to manage dependencies across the application. This allows for loose coupling and easier testing. Key components are injected into controllers and services using NestJS's DI container.

## Folder Structure

- **`src/`**: Main source directory containing application modules and logic.
  - **`auth/`**: Handles authentication logic, including JWT strategies and guards.
  - **`common/`**: Contains shared modules, DTOs, filters, exceptions, and utilities.
  - **`config/`**: Manages configuration and environment validation.
  - **`rbac/`**: Implements role-based access control (optional feature).
  - **`database/`**: Contains database connection configurations and models.
  - **`utils/`**: Provides utility functions and helpers.

## Design Decisions

- **Modular Design**: The application is divided into modules, each responsible for a specific feature or functionality. This promotes separation of concerns and reusability.
- **Scalability**: The architecture supports horizontal scaling and can be easily extended with new modules and features.
- **Testability**: The use of DI and modular design enhances testability, allowing for isolated unit tests and integration tests.
- **Security**: Implements JWT-based authentication and optional RBAC for secure access control.

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a solid foundation for building robust and scalable backend applications. It leverages NestJS's features to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase, making it easy for developers to extend and customize the boilerplate for their specific needs.
