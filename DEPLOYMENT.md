# Deployment Guide

This document outlines best practices for deploying the NestJS Backend Boilerplate to production environments, including using DigitalOcean, Docker, and PM2.

## Deployment Best Practices

### Preparation

- **Environment Variables**: Ensure all necessary environment variables are set and secure.
- **Build the Application**: Run the build command to compile TypeScript to JavaScript.

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

### Docker Deployment

- **Dockerize the Application**: Use the provided `Dockerfile` to build a Docker image.

  ```bash
  docker build -t nestjs-backend .
  ```

- **Run with Docker Compose**: Use `docker-compose` to manage multi-container applications.

  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

### PM2 Deployment

- **Install PM2**: Use PM2 to manage application processes.

  ```bash
  npm install pm2 -g
  ```

- **Start the Application**: Use PM2 to start and manage the application.

  ```bash
  pm2 start dist/main.js --name nestjs-backend
  ```

### DigitalOcean Deployment

- **Droplet Setup**: Create a new droplet and SSH into it.
- **Environment Setup**: Install Node.js, npm, and other dependencies.
- **Deploy Application**: Clone the repository, set environment variables, and start the application using PM2 or Docker.

## Monitoring and Logging

- **Use PM2 Monitoring**: PM2 provides built-in monitoring and logging features.
- **External Monitoring Tools**: Consider using tools like Sentry or New Relic for advanced monitoring.

## Conclusion

Following these deployment best practices will help ensure a smooth and reliable production environment for your application. Adjust the steps as needed to fit your specific infrastructure and requirements.
